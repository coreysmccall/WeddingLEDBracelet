/*
 * Corey.ino
 * Corey's firmware for wedding bracelet.
 * 
 * There are two modes:
 * - The default mode makes the bracelet twinkle
 * - The second mode is for “dancing”: Most LEDs brightly flash or twinkle only around the time you are moving. When you are still, only the yellow LEDs are on to indicate you are in this mode.
 * 
 * Change mode by double tapping the bracelet where it says “tap tap”
